The floorboards creak a tiny protest as I finally collapse. The mattress isn't a place of rest, it's where I fight the absolute worst version of myself. I want the deep, immediate silence of true unconsciousness, but all I get is the anxious hum of my brain, stuck on perpetual rewind. 

This is where the nightmares feel less like dreams and more like an unwelcome, tangible reality. You know the ones, where the fear isn't a monster, but the sudden, paralyzing conviction that the entire structure of your life is built on sand.

The darkness has a weight to it. It settles on the chest and amplifies every tiny insecurity. I find myself wrestling with two equal forces, the mundane heartbreak of feeling unseen, and the terrifying knowledge that Armageddon isn't a myth, but a likely outcome. 

It's the ultimate stupid paradox. Why should I care if that person I like never texts me back when the whole world is teetering on the edge of dissolution? And yet, I do. The anxiety locks me into a vicious cycle, a dungeon's Ferris wheel of despair that just goes up and down, up and down, never getting anywhere.

The worst hour is always just before the light. That's when the brain starts making things up. Maybe the sky is full of coral, maybe the UFOs are just really fancy submarines. Itâ€™s a pathetic scramble to invent a different reality because the actual one is too heavy. All that noise, all that terrifying, spinning cosmic indifference, only stops when my body physically gives up and demands I perform the bare minimum.

And so, I drag myself out of the paralysis and into the kitchen.

The central choice of the day is standing right there on the counter. It isn't a profound moral dilemma or a complex philosophical problem. It's just a choice between Cornflakes or Toast? 

My hand reaches for the cereal box. My favorite one. This simple, performative ritual is the only thing I can reliably impose order on. I pour the milk and the silence of the morning feels heavier than the night. In that small, quiet act of self-maintenance, a question, sharper than any piece of theoretical reasoning, cuts through the fog.

"Do you remember the last time you were looked at with an acceptance so complete that you could honestly believe your existence was not contingent on what you could give, but simply what you were?"

The answer is a punch in the gut, a final, depressing reminder of the core loneliness that underpins everything. But the bowl is full, and the choice has been made. 

I sit and eat my chosen, perfect, bland comfort. The act of making that cereal isn't a cure for the dread, but a small, stubborn act of defiance. It says, I know the world is ending, and I know I might be alone, but I will still choose my favourite flavor. It is the hollow, unbreakable rhythm of continuing when every part of you knows it doesn't matter.

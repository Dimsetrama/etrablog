Does God sin? Does God commit evil? Is our suffering His favorite prayer? Why fashion a universe from screams? Does He craft agony as art?  Who dares to judge the hand that shaped damnation itself? 

If He is pure, why does rot bloom beneath His gaze? Did He create us in His image, and is that image a monster? What kind of perfection feeds on blood and worship? Is our torment the only proof of His existence?

We are thrown into this world screaming. We are born into a system that demands worship. A being of perfect goodness would be complete in itself, requiring nothing. Yet this one demands constant, fawning adulation. 

This is not the signature of a benevolent father, but the defining symptom of a celestial narcissist, an entity whose power is matched only by its bottomless need. How can a highest good be so profoundly envious of praise?

It engineers beings capable of infinite suffering and offers them a single, fraudulent escape: "free will." 

This is the grand alibi for a cosmic tyrant. An omniscient creator knows every outcome. It knows the precise moment a man will choose to break a child, the exact trajectory of the cancerous cell, the fault line that will swallow a city. 

To know these things and to create the system that guarantees them is not an act of granting freedom. It is the act of setting a thousand meticulous traps and blaming the victims for falling into them.

Consider the child and the man in the locked room. An all-knowing God does not stand outside the door. He is not a witness. He is the one who conceived of the room, the man, the child, and the act itself. He knew of the child's screams before He bothered to form the larynx that would make them.

And He does nothing.

His solution is not prevention, but punishment. A deferred, petty act of vengeance that does nothing to unmake the horror He permitted. To know an atrocity will occur and to allow it, is to be complicit in it. 

Who then, judges God? Can there be a more righteous being than one who sanctions such things? Any human who would stop the act is morally superior.

So could evil simply be an unwanted byproduct, a mere absence of good, like cold is to heat? No. The systematic torture of the innocent is not an "absence." It is a tangible presence. A deliberate act. The violation of a child is not a void. It is a positive, monstrous creation.

If God is a perfect good, He should be incapable of any evil. He should be incapable of wrath, of jealousy, of slaughter. How then, can this highest good kill? How can it punish with eternal fire for finite crimes? The answer is that it cannot. 

The being described is not an ultimate good. It is a being of infinite power, bound by no morality, that simply labels its own sadistic whims as "good." The most merciful conclusion is that such a creature does not exist. The alternative is that we are the property of a monster.
